# Open Source Python Packages in Hydrology
My attempt to list interesting open source python projects that can be used in the field of Hydrology. Suggestions as issues or pull requests are welcome!

UPDATE: The Pypa package authority has now added ["Hydrology" as a classifier](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/5728) so we can start [collecting python packages](https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Topic+%3A%3A+Scientific%2FEngineering+%3A%3A+Hydrology) used by the hydrological community! If you are maintaining a python package, please add `Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Hydrology` to your setup.py so people can find your package.
